# Naming Convention

Naming things is hard and I've tried several different approaches. I tried
naming things as what they are (heading-1, heading-2 etc.), I also tried the
t-shirt size variant (small, medium, large etc.). But I always find myself going
back and changing things up.

Then I came across
[this](http://danmall.me/articles/typography-in-design-systems/) article written
by Dan Mall. And I was thinking of trying a new way of thinking. Using a
numerical value from 1 - 7 with a descripting prefix, where 1 is the smallest
and 7 are the larges value.
