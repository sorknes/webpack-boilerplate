# Prerequisites

To use this boilerplate, there are some things that need to be in place.

## Environment

- Node v.8.x+
- NPM v.6.x+

We use the latest [Long Term Support](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node
version; 8.x (Carbon), which was released Oct 2017. This ensures things are fast
without overhead of polyfills in our build tools.
